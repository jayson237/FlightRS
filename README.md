# Merlion Flight RS
Flight Reservation System made with Jakarta EE and JPQL as part of IS2103 Final Project

## The Narrative
Merlion Airlines is a new regional low cost carrier (LCC) serving the Asia Pacific region
from its home base in Singapore. The IATA (International Air Transport Association) airline
code of Merlion Airlines is ML, and the IATA airport code of its home airport, i.e.,
Singapore Changi Airport, is SIN. The company will commence business operation in
January 2024 and is currently preparing for its launch. As part of the preparation, Merlion
Airlines has engaged Kent Ridge Technology (KRT), a global technology consulting and
solution development company that is headquartered in Singapore, to develop a new Flight
Reservation System (FRS) to support its core business processes. More specifically, the new
FRS will be used by Merlion Airlines to handle fleet management, route planning, flight
schedule management, seat pricing and flight reservation. The customers of Merlion Airlines
will also be using the system to book flight tickets.
In addition to its own internal use, the FRS will also be exposed to external partners such as
price comparison websites, online travel websites and travel agencies. This will allow
Merlion Airlines to sell its flight seats to a wider audience. At this juncture, Merlion Airlines
has already inked an agreement with Holiday.com. This would allow users of Holiday.comâ€™s
Holiday Reservation System to search for flights and book flight tickets from Merlion
Airlines as part of their holiday packages.
